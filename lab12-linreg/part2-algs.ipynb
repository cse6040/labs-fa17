    "2. For the specific problem of linear least squares, a method based on QR factorization is better than forming the Gram matrix, which squares the condition number. Although we did not discuss the theory of QR better, it exemplifies a common pattern or trick in linear algebraic problems: converting the original problem (or matrix) into one whose structure is easier to solve.\n",
